# C2 Framework: Project Zeus (Placeholder Name - can be changed!)

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a sophisticated, multi-functional Command and Control (C2) framework designed for realistic red teaming simulations. Our primary focus is on developing stealthy communication methods and robust agent functionalities, starting with Windows targets.

This framework is for educational and research purposes only, intended to deepen understanding of offensive security techniques, network communication, and defensive countermeasures. **It must only be used in controlled, authorized environments.**

## Features (Planned)

* **Server Interface:** Command-Line Interface (CLI)
* **Initial Agent Target:** Windows
* **Initial Communication:** DNS Tunneling
* **Core Agent Functionalities:**
    * Execute shell commands
    * Upload/Download files
    * List directories
    * Gather basic system information
    * (Future) Process manipulation, screenshot, keylogging, persistence, etc.

## Architecture

* **C2 Server:** Developed in Python, managing agents, tasks, and handling incoming communications.
* **C2 Agents:** Initially developed in Python for Windows, designed to be lightweight and stealthy.
* **Communication:** Agent-to-Server communication initially utilizes DNS tunneling for covert data exfiltration and command ingress.

## Setup & Installation

**(To be filled in detail later in `docs/setup_guide.md`)**

### Prerequisites:
* Python 3.x
* A registered domain name (for DNS tunneling)
* A publicly accessible server/VPS for the C2 server

## Usage

**(To be filled in detail later in `docs/usage_guide.md`)**

## Development Status

* **Phase 1: Foundational C2 (Minimal Viable Product with DNS Tunneling)**
    * Milestone 1.1: Core C2 Server (Python CLI) - **In Progress**
    * Milestone 1.2: DNS Tunneling Module for Server
    * Milestone 1.3: Basic Windows Agent (Python)
    * Milestone 1.4: Command & Control Flow
